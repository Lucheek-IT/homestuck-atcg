# Homestuck ATCG Web
This is a website documenting the rules and cards for the Homestuck: Atypical Card Game.

## Usage
todo.

News posts will be reflected in the RSS feed, so people can follow updates to the site. There's probably a Discord bot that can subscribe to that too.

### Updating the Card Database
also todo.

i think you were using a tool that can export the cards to excel? this can process the CSV...so maybe it can be as easy as updating that? i need a sample of what it gives you -- hoping it's like a zip file with the CSV + card art. 

## Tech
This is build with the following components:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/), a framework for building static sites
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a CSS framework
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), a lite Javascript framework
- [GitHub](https://github.com), which stores the source code and runs the Astro builds to turn this into a heap of HTML
- Something, where it's hosted 
  - idk if you want to stick with neocities, put it on your own server, or what.
  - It's Just HTML(tm), so it can live anywhere.
