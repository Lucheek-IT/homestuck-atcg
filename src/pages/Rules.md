I'm working on updating terminology, but the concepts are the same.

## Basic Concepts
The game consists of 2 to 5 players competiting against eachother to be the single winner. The winner is decided by the player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game. Each player will have a Main Deck that consits of 48 cards, and a single, additional special Planet Card. Players assemble their deck before the game begins.

Players take turns being the Active Player. A turn consists of multiple phases. After the final phase of an Active Player's turn, the next player takes a turn. After every player has had a turn, a new Round begins- and each player takes another turn. The rounds continue until a player reaches 7 Victory Points, which triggers End Game. During End Game, every other player takes one more turn, and then the game ends and a winner is decided.

To earn Victoy Points, a player must have more Power at an opposing player's location at the end of a turn. Players choose to either put their Character Cards (cards with a Power value) at their own location, to prevent opposing players from scoring Victory Points there, or at another player's location to score Victory Points themselves.

During an Active Player's turn, the player has a limited amount of actions they can perform. The amount of actions they take is determined by the player's current Grist. Performing actions costs a certain amount of Grist, which replenishes at the beginning of the player's turn. A player can also choose to save their Grist up between multiple turns, declaring an end to their turn before all their Grist is spent.

A common action a player can take is to Tap their character card. When a card is tapped, it is physically rotated 90 degrees to the right (clearly indicating the card has been tapped, and can't be tapped again.) Tapping costs 1 Grist. When a character card is tapped by the active player, all other player's character cards with less power at the same location of the tapped card are destroyed. Destroyed cards go to their player's discard pile, and do not count as having power at any location.

At the end of a player's Main Phase, any character cards at their own planet's location that have not been tapped, collect one Boon. Boons are special markers that can be spent to activate special actions, or give unique bonuses to a character card. Character Cards only earn boons at their own player's planet's location and only if they are untapped that turn. A Character Card can only have a maximum of 3 Boons.
